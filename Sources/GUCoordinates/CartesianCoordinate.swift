/// A cartesian_coordinate is a general coordinate for representing positions
/// on a tow dimensional plane.
///
/// This coordinate describes the position through the x and y axes. The
/// `CartesianCoordinate` is generally used for the coordinate system of the
/// soccer field. This describes the world (or more specifically the field)
/// in terms of the location of each side of the soccer field. The home side
/// is in the west, whereas the away side is in the east. Because of this, it
/// may not be a good idea to repurpose this coordinate for use in other
/// applications since the x and y coordinates of this coordinate must be in
/// millimetres.
///
/// The field coordinate system can be depicted graphically as follows:
/// ```
///                                    ^
